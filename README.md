| Trackpad | ❓ | Not Fix This |
| Sleep | ❓ | Not Fix This |
| WebCam | ❓ | Not Fix This |
| Hardware Acceleration | ❓ | Apps requiring hardware acceleration crashes, more info [here](https://github.com/NootInc/NootedRed/issues/13). This can be prevented by disabling hardware acceleration on those apps or by increasing the VRAM size to 1GB+. You can use [Smokeless UMAF AMD Tool](https://github.com/DavidS95/Smokeless_UMAF).|
